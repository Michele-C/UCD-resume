I am creating a ucd resume page.
We created an assets folder and in there a css and an images folder.
We created an index.html - added a boiler plate and the bootstrap cdn links for css and fontawesome
This was done inthe head section.
In the body section we added the following elements: header, section and footer.
We did a git add index.html
a git commit -m " Iinitial commit"
